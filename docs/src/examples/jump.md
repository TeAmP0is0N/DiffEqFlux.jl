# Neural Jump Diffusions (Neural Jump SDE) and Neural Partial Differential Equations (Neural PDEs)

For the sake of not having a never-ending documentation of every single
combination of CPU/GPU with every layer and every neural differential equation,
we will end here. But you may want to consult [this blog
post](http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/neural-jump-sdes-jump-diffusions-and-neural-pdes/)
which showcases defining neural jump diffusions and neural partial differential
equations.
